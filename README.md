# BG3 Mod Helper - A VSCod(e/ium) Extension

Created by ghostboats and khbsd, this VSCod(e/ium) extension is designed to help mod authors speed up their mod creation workflows. The extension includes multiple useful utilities such as:

- **Mod Packing/Unpacking**
- **UUID/Handle Generation**
- **UUID Mapping**
- **Handle Management**
- **LSX/XML/LOCA/ETC File Conversions**
- **Generate Mod Templates**
- **Atlas Generation**
- **And More!**

This tool is very functional and follows the philosophy of “Few clicks, few tabs,” enabling modding without frequent tabbing out and minimizing the number of clicks needed. It’s available for both VSCode and VSCodium.
